## Intro:
Hello! Ever since I was old enough to open my own brokerage account, algorithmic trading has piqued my interest. During my time in school, I embarked on several personal projects centered around algo trading and stock market analysis. This project is an improvement of my previous work, with a focus on data gathering and preparation. Through this project, I also aim to showcase fundamental skills like object-oriented programming, data analysis, Python coding, and machine learning techniques. Join me as I explore the world of data-driven trading strategies and bring insights to the ever-dynamic stock market.
